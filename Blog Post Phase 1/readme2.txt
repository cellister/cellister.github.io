Blog 1: Five reasons why Python is a great add on skill to a chemistry degree

You may be considering what to do with a degree in chemistry; now is an excellent time for making a huge leap into data science and machine learning! First, what does a data scientist do? Much like a chemist, data scientists explore questions and, through finding related data, make recommendations to stakeholders on key decisions. In addition to honing keen analytical skills to analyze large data sets, data scientists organize and formally present the data to stakeholders. 

Here are some key points to consider:

1.	“Programming in Python empowers chemists to apply their domain knowledge to scales unreachable by manual effort.”-ACS

Look at it this way, you already analyze mounds of data, what if you could complete that work in a fraction of the time? Honestly, being able to communicate with a computer is a basic and useful skill that every scientist can benefit from. What’s best is that because Python IS so widely used there are many packages that have already been developed to help you in your work!

2.	It’s learnable.

Listen, learning to code from scratch is often an overwhelming prospect, but think of it this way, only half of coding/Data Science is actually the technical language, the rest consists of analytical and reasoning skills that chemists have already mastered!

In short, though, Python is an adaptable language used ubiquitously for fast prototyping. It’s open-source nature, code readability and sheer computing power give it many advantages to reaching a large audience of users, which explains why it is the fastest-growing programming language today. Basically, it won’t matter which field you choose to use your chemistry degree in because Python is already there.

3.	Professional visualizations.

Say good-bye to the simple, stock graphics of excel and welcome Python. Python has numerous libraries for visualizing large data sets that are fully customizable. Professional visualizations can impact the success of your project. Here are some examples of the truly impactful visualizations that you could design with your data to bring results to your audience or stakeholders. https://mode.com/blog/python-data-visualization-libraries/
   

4.	Artificial Intelligence.

Python is one of the best choices for solving problems in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. That said, with AI and ChatGPT leading us toward the future, rest assured that Python has libraries that enable machine learning processing and that can aid in computer image recognition.

5.	Salary.

Knowing how to handle both large and small data sets will open career and salary opportunities that you may not have realized existed. According to Glassdoor, the average salary for a data scientist in the USA is $125,242/year. I’ve seen chemists do almost everything. Chemists work in the fields of law (patent law), R&D, education, food (who wouldn’t want to be an ice cream chemist?), chemical processing, engineering, forensics, conservation, sales, consulting (some on TV and movies!), scientific writing, and so many more! One thing that all jobs today have in common is reliance on technology to make progress. The rapid growth and integration of technologies have given chemists the tools and freedom to take their creativity and ideas to new levels. Here's a podcast that delves a bit deeper into this point: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01187-6


In conclusion, programming methods such as Python are revolutionizing the way we approach experimentation and modeling. Since data scientists require technical skills and practical knowledge about their field, it means that you may not need an additional university degree. In my case, I’ve chosen to pursue a certificate in a well-rounded curriculum that offers me the opportunity to build a large portfolio. Accelerating our progress and understanding is more important now than in any previous generation. The key to keeping up with new scientific information is to remain agile and equip yourself with the skills to access and contribute to the scientific understand of our world.
